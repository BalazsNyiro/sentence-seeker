Install on win10:
=================

 - install Python:
    https://www.python.org/downloads/windows

    latest Python 3 stable release:
    Windows x86-64 executable installer

 - download sentence-seeker:
   https://github.com/BalazsNyiro/sentence-seeker/archive/master.zip
 
 you can extract the zip where you want, 
 I use it from Documents/sentence-seeker folder:
 - Open the zip file in Downloads folder
   and move sentence-seeker-master into Documents

 - enter Documents/sentence-seeker-master folder

 - first start needs about  30-40 sec because the program
   creates word indexes from default books/articles

   If you want to see what happens in the background:

     - double click on sentence-seeker.py
       if you want you can use pre-collected 
       wikipedia articles as text sources,
       say yes in the console
  
   If you want to start gui only (no python console window):
    
     - double click on sentence-seeker.pyw   
       (program uses precollected wikipedia articles
        from sentence-seeker site by default)

Install on Linux:
=================

 - install Python3 on your Linux
 - git clone or download the repo content
   somewhere in your home dir

General informations:
=====================

Console start: sentence-seeker.py --ui console
    Gui start: sentence-seeker.py --ui tkinter

The program creates .sentence-seeker directory in user's home dir
and stores documents in HOME/.sentence-seeker/documents dir.

If you insert a new text or html or pdf doc into 
HOME/.sentence-seeker/documents dir, the program indexes it at first time and split it into sentences, once - later it uses the sentence
and index files.
